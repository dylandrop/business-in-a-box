Create a command that does the following. The command should be AGNOSTIC to this repository, so you don’t need to read in the whole project before getting back to me:  “””
Phase 1) In parallel, assess whether the project has assessed all go-live needs to make the current project into a production-ready business: unimplemented necessary customer workflows, billing, analytics, testing, error-handling, feedback funnels (e.g. email, reporting bugs), auth, security, staging environments, CI/CD. For each agent report back findings + implementation suggestions to a staged file per agent so progress is not lost. 
Phase 2) Compile results to make a list of recommendations. (1) anything that requires setting up new external services (even if they have free-tier) like Clerk, Railway, Vercel, etc. (2) other major business choices. Work through suggestions with me one-by-one. (3) summarize remaining medium-minor business choices, but keep it short 
Phase 3) Finalize into a comprehensive go-live checklist and save to a .md file. You do not have to read everything out to the user, they can find it in the .md if they want it
 
“””

Please assess the generated command from the following angles:
(1) Parallelization amongst agents (2) Making sure that agents won’t overwrite each others’ work.
(3) Token efficiency, the command should try to be mostly token efficient  And implement all improvements, write that back into the command
